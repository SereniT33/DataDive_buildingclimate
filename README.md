## Repository Description
This repository serves as a part of the data science portfolio of Serena Seoyeon Choi. In particular, this project showcases the following skills:
* to **extract, transform and load** geospatial data
* to create a sample EDA and visualization

## Project 
### Description
The project was coordinated by DataKind for the DataDive event held from 09/15/23 to 09/17/23. The goal of the project was to provide a prototype of a global census of built environment, using satellite imagery, other open-sourced data and AI/ML algorithms to IMF. The expected oucomes include replicable classficiation models, visualization tools and open-source imageries to empower countries with less ground-truth data to bridge the data gap in conducting their national structure censuses. 

### Contribution
I contributed to the project by performing ETL processes required for developing a mapping layer of structure level attributes, including area, height, type of structure and other relevant information. 
Specifically, my task involved:
* accurately associating builting footprint data with specific geographic locations and validating the accuracy of boundaries for the regions of interest
* extracting structure-level attributes and enriching building footprint dataset
